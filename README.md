PRRSV-2 Neutralization prediction via genetic sequences
================

PRRSLoom‑Neutralization Predictor is a web‑based computational tool 
designed to predict the likelihood that porcine reproductive and 
respiratory syndrome virus type 2 (PRRSV‑2) outbreak strains will 
be neutralized by sera generated from vaccines or live virus 
inoculations (LVI). The tool lets users upload viral nucleotide 
sequences (either just outbreak strains or both outbreak and 
vaccine/LVI sequences) in FASTA format and choose between single‑gene 
(ORF5) or multi‑gene (ORF2–ORF7) prediction models. It uses machine 
learning algorithms trained on experimental neutralization assay data 
to estimate neutralization outcomes, incorporating sequence‑derived 
features such as amino acid physicochemical properties, genetic 
distances, and structural protein patterns to generate predictions 
with reported internal accuracy up to 88–90% and validated external 
accuracy of 83% for the ORF5 model. The output includes downloadable 
summary tables and logs to support interpretation, while automatic 
variant classification and comparisons to built‑in vaccine strains 
help contextualize results. This tool is intended as a screening aid to 
inform expectations about cross‑protective immunity, not as a replacement 
for confirmatory laboratory neutralization assays.
